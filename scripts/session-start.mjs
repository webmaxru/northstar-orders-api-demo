/**
 * Resolve the active task contract when an agent session starts.
 *
 * Wired to the SessionStart hook. Nobody should have to run a command by hand
 * before working: a contract you must remember to fetch is a contract that will
 * be missing exactly when it matters.
 *
 * Task identity is explicit input: AGENT_TASK_ISSUE, the documented initial
 * prompt fields, or cloud agent's COPILOT_AGENT_PROMPT. Conflicting selectors
 * fail closed; branch names and cached tasks are never task selectors.
 *
 * Interactive sessions do not use it. There, the human passes the issue number
 * to `/plan` or `/implement` and the UserPromptSubmit hook resolves it. Nothing
 * is inferred from the branch name or the open issue list any more: those
 * guesses were usually right, which is precisely why nobody checked them.
 *
 * With no issue, the session still starts and reports that no contract is
 * active. It deliberately does NOT fall back to a fixture under tests/fixtures:
 * those exist to recreate an issue, and silently treating one as the contract
 * would hide the fact that the real one was never read.
