# Runtime architecture

Northstar is a stateless TypeScript/Fastify Orders API. PostgreSQL is the
durability and concurrency boundary for idempotent order creation.

  C[Client] --> L[Load balancer]
  L --> A[API instance A]
  L --> B[API instance B]
  A --> P[(PostgreSQL)]
  B --> P
```

Any retry may reach a different process. Process memory is neither shared nor
durable, so it cannot coordinate idempotency.

## HTTP surface

### `GET /health`

Returns:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### `POST /orders`

Accepts:

```json
{
  "sku": "WIDGET-1",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

`sku` must be a non-empty string and `quantity` must be an integer from 1
through 100.

The optional `Idempotency-Key` header must contain 8 through 128 letters,
numbers, dots, underscores, colons, or hyphens.

| Outcome | Status | Replay header |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New order | `201` | `x-idempotent-replay: false` |
| Same key and request | `200` | `x-idempotent-replay: true` |
| Same key, different request | `409` | not applicable |
| Invalid input or key | `400` | not applicable |
| Unexpected failure | `500` | not applicable |

## Idempotency transaction

For a request with an idempotency key:

1. Validate the order and key.
2. Canonically serialize `{ quantity, sku }` and hash the request.
3. Salt and hash the idempotency key with SHA-256.
4. Begin a PostgreSQL transaction.
5. Acquire a transaction-scoped advisory lock derived from the key hash.
6. Delete an expired record for that key, if present.
7. Read the current idempotency record.
8. Return its stored response when the request hash matches.
9. Return a conflict when the request hash differs.
10. Otherwise insert the order and idempotency record in the same transaction.
11. Commit and release the connection.

The advisory lock removes the check-then-act race across API instances. The
single transaction prevents an order from committing without its completed
replay record.

## Persistence

`orders` contains:

- UUID order ID;
- SKU;
- quantity;
- creation timestamp.

`idempotency_records` contains:

- a fixed-length key hash as the primary key;
- a fixed-length canonical request hash;
- the related order ID;
- the response body needed for replay;
- creation and expiration timestamps.

Records expire after 24 hours. Expired records are removed lazily when the same
key is used again.

Raw idempotency keys and raw request payloads are not persisted. Application
and workflow logs must not contain them.

## Baseline mode

When `DATABASE_URL` is absent, `src/server.ts` uses an in-memory order
repository. This mode demonstrates the basic API but intentionally does not
claim cross-instance idempotency.

When `DATABASE_URL` is present, the server uses
`PostgresIdempotentOrderService`.

## Telemetry

The reference metrics interface records replay and conflict counts without
recording keys or payloads. The current in-memory metrics implementation is
used by acceptance tests and can be replaced by a production metrics adapter.

## Failure behavior

- Validation errors return a controlled `400`.
- Reusing a key for a different request returns a controlled `409`.
- Database or unexpected failures roll back and return a generic `500`.
- If both the transaction and rollback fail, the service surfaces both errors
  as an `AggregateError`.
- The implementation does not retry database operations indefinitely.

## Evidence

Unit tests cover domain, service, policy, and evidence behavior without
external dependencies.

PostgreSQL acceptance tests create two service instances over one database and
prove:

- same-instance replay;
- cross-instance replay;
- conflicting payload rejection;
- exactly one order under concurrent cross-instance retries;
- baseline behavior without a key;
- replay and conflict metrics;
- HTTP behavior across two Fastify instances;
- fixed-length hashes instead of raw sensitive values.

Each acceptance suite that uses PostgreSQL receives a cryptographically unique
temporary schema and a schema-scoped connection string. The test-owned control
connection drops only that schema after application pools and child processes
close. This lets Vitest run the idempotency, privacy, and process suites in
parallel without sharing `orders` types, table resets, or rows.
The helper rejects remote database hosts and requires
`NORTHSTAR_ACCEPTANCE_DATABASE_DISPOSABLE=true` as an explicit acknowledgement.
The governed-change workflow sets that value only for its ephemeral PostgreSQL
service. For local runs, set it only after confirming `DATABASE_URL` names a
disposable local test database.

See [`adr/007-durable-idempotency.md`](adr/007-durable-idempotency.md) for the
decision record.

## Repair of the agent control plane

The `AES-SURFACE-EVIDENCE` repair is bound to task
[issue 14](https://github.com/webmaxru/northstar-orders-api-demo/issues/14) and
the approved bootstrap [plan PR 15](https://github.com/webmaxru/northstar-orders-api-demo/pull/15).
These are fictional reference-system tasks, not production incidents.

The guide's plan-first option requires a PR containing only the plan, not a
zero-file diff. New publication therefore commits the task's regular Markdown
artifact at `docs/plans/<task-id>.md`, using an isolated Git index. It does not
stage or publish the caller's unrelated working-tree edits. Only the explicitly
authorized publisher writes this artifact; the planner remains read-only.
Configured eligible human reviewers are requested when the PR is published.
Native review approval is derived from the committed artifact and its current
task/base/head identities. A mutated PR-description mirror is rejected.
The old zero-file approval record is accepted only for the pinned bootstrap.

SessionStart accepts documented initial prompt fields and the cloud prompt
environment variable in addition to an explicit issue variable. Prompt-hook
failure clears only cached authority owned by that session. Foreign-owner
conflicts and ownerless legacy task caches are preserved and fail closed. All
edit paths, including supported absolute paths and patch moves, are checked
against the repository, task and plan.
Unknown payloads cannot widen scope. The cloud path requires a real matching
PR and immutable plan/task/base/head identity, not just a `copilot/` prefix.
One repository-level Stop dispatcher selects the explicit plan or implement
role, preserving the host's session identity and stop-loop flag.

Evidence must bind real artifacts and complete producer identity. Missing,
modified, stale or mismatched task/plan/base/head/run/attempt evidence fails.
Dirty local source cannot be represented solely by HEAD. Stop validates the
current plan and evidence-command result rather than reusing an older passing
report; bounded recovery escalates instead of reporting a successful fallback.
Scanner invocation, parsing and input-read failures are validation failures.
The compiler wrapper additionally rejects error diagnostics even when the
compiler process exits zero.

The new process acceptance test starts separate Node servers using the real
application, shared PostgreSQL and actual HTTP. It uses a unique test schema,
checks concurrent replay, conflicting payloads and process restart, and cleans
up only that schema and those processes. This complements, rather than relabels,
the earlier in-process acceptance tests.

These source changes do not prove a deployed browser flow, host parity, or
hosted acceptance. A new browser-only plan review and real CLI/VS Code/cloud
canaries remain acceptance requirements after the changed controls are reviewed.
Rules/branch protection, protected environments, App identities and secrets
are external administrator settings, not established by repository files.

The combined-mode controller now selects a lower-risk proposed plan from the
same implementation PR, not a separate `plan/<task>` PR. It validates live task,
base/head, repository and ancestry and creates no approval record. Local
`/work` startup may prepare only a bounded proposal artifact, then activate it
through the dedicated materialization command before any source edit.
Resuming local proposals requires an explicit artifact selector and fresh
validation; existing files are not default authority. Hosted workflows select
the candidate or independently approved plan according to risk and retain
security checks and final human acceptance for both modes.

### Parallel task workspaces

Copilot CLI and cloud-agent task sessions may proceed in parallel only when
each writer has an isolated task worktree. The repository's Local agent mode
remains serial. `npm run workspace:prepare -- --issue <number> --path
<absolute-path> --session-id <session-id>` resolves the live issue and current
approved plan, verifies the immutable base, and creates a dedicated
`agent/implement/<task-id>` worktree without switching the caller's checkout.
It refuses an existing path, stale base, unapproved plan, or branch already
owned by another worktree.

Within a worktree, `artifacts/task-workspace-owner.json` binds the task issue,
contract digest, repository, worktree, and session/run identity. Resolver state
is protected by an atomic short-lived lock. The owner key hashes the canonical
worktree path and explicit session/run identity; the raw session ID is not
stored in the owner record. An interrupted lock is reclaimed only by the same
owner on the same host after its recorded process has exited. Malformed,
foreign-owner, or cross-host locks fail closed.

A conflicting session fails before task caches, evidence, or retry state are
cleared or overwritten. Ownerless legacy task authority is never adopted or
deleted by normal task startup. After the owning session has ended, release
only its own workspace with
`npm run workspace:release -- --issue <number> --session-id <session-id>`;
the command validates the exact owner before clearing task state. If no owner
exists but legacy task authority files remain, a human may explicitly confirm
the bounded cleanup command
`npm run workspace:release -- --issue <number> --session-id <session-id> --clear-unowned`.
The pre-tool policy asks before this operation; it cannot release an active
owner or remove paths outside the known task-authority cache list.
The orphan cleanup removes only the known task contract/plan/session cache files;
other evidence remains untouched and is not adopted as authority.

GitHub Actions runs use a separate ephemeral checkout per run. After
`contract:from-pr` resolves a same-repository PR to its live issue, it may
replace only the known orphaned task-authority caches in that run's workspace,
bound to the exact repository, run ID, and attempt. It never imports a
producer's cached task contract as authority. This exception does not apply to
local sessions.

Stop retry history is namespaced by repository, task, contract, plan, base, and
session identity. The Stop gate verifies that the task-session record and
workspace owner agree before writing check evidence or retry state. Audit
attribution includes a task and plan only when the hook session matches that
same owner.

Local audit JSONL files are separated by a hash of the explicit session ID.
Workflow concurrency remains keyed by branch or exact shared target: independent
branches are not globally serialized, while production and other privileged
targets remain serialized. A worktree/schema fixture proves the mechanism but
does not substitute for the issue-required live CLI and cloud canaries; those
surfaces remain unverified until actual task sessions produce inspectable
evidence.

A real CodeQL run exposed valid informational SARIF notifications whose
`message.text` is empty. The parser now accepts that valid message shape while
still failing absent/wrong-typed diagnostics, error-level notifications,
unsuccessful invocations and findings. The downloaded original CodeQL result
was revalidated directly; this is distinct from claiming every hosted gate passed.

### Adoption settings

`CUSTOMIZE` comments mark runtime invocation, reviewer ownership, workflow
model/budget/retention, scanner versions and test-database endpoints.
Governance JSON uses `$comment` rather than invalid JSON comments. The
`optionalCapabilities.mcp` and `optionalCapabilities.continuousAI` switches
default to enabled when omitted; disabling one requires removing its active
integration files too. Remove the Northstar-specific legacy-plan exception
when adopting in another repository. Protocol schemas, approval identity and
evidence requirements are not convenience switches.
The unit commands cap workers at two to avoid saturating a shared development
machine with the Git/process fixture tests. The 30-second test timeout permits
process startup on Windows; individual behavior assertions remain unchanged.
